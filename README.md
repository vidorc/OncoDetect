OncoDetect AI: Breast Cancer Classification
üìñ Overview
OncoDetect AI is a deep learning project focused on the early and accurate classification of breast tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Using features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, this model provides a powerful tool to assist pathologists and clinicians in making faster, more informed diagnoses.

This model is built using a neural network implemented in PyTorch.

üéØ Purpose & Importance
Early detection is a critical factor in improving breast cancer outcomes. The goal of this project is to create a reliable, automated system that can serve as a second opinion for medical professionals. By leveraging the power of AI, we can:

Improve Diagnostic Accuracy: Reduce human error and bias in tumor classification.

Accelerate Diagnosis: Provide rapid analysis of medical data.

Serve as an Educational Tool: Help researchers and students understand the application of AI in oncology.

‚ú® Features
Binary Classification: Accurately classifies tumors as benign or malignant.

High Performance: Built with PyTorch for efficient training and inference.

Data-Driven: Trained on the widely-used Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

Model Evaluation: Includes key metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the AUC-ROC curve to thoroughly assess performance.

üíª Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch: For building and training the neural network model.

Pandas & NumPy: For data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn: For data splitting and performance evaluation metrics.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting the confusion matrix.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the official website. Then, install the other required libraries:

# Example for a specific CUDA version, check the PyTorch website for your setup
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/OncoDetect-AI.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd OncoDetect-AI

Usage
You can run the train.py script to train the model from scratch or use predict.py with a pre-trained model to classify new data.

(You will need to create these scripts to define your model architecture, training loop, and prediction logic.)

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The model is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) test. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as:

radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean

smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean

A neural network is constructed using PyTorch. The network takes these 30 features as input, passes them through several hidden layers with activation functions (like ReLU), and produces a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation. This output represents the probability that the tumor is malignant.

Target Variable: diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations & Disclaimer
Not a Medical Device: This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only. It is not a certified medical device and should not be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for professional medical advice.

Professional Oversight: Any clinical decisions based on the output of this model must be made by a qualified healthcare provider.

Model Limitations: The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and characteristics of the data it was trained on. It may not perform equally well on data from different populations or sources.
